I want to reiterate to the administration, the way to get relieved to Ukraine quickly, is for the Ukraine package to move by itself. There is overwhelming bipartisan support for getting the Ukrainians as much help as they need, as quickly as possible. For that to happen here in the Congress, that package needs to be moved all by itself without the other extraneous issues that we\u2019ve been debating related to title 42 in additional help for therapeutics.

And I hope that the leaker who is extremely likely to be found, given a limited number of people who have the ability to access early drafts of opinions, will be dealt with as severely as the law may allow.","If Roe is struck down, do you see a need for federal abortion restriction legislation in Congress?","If Roe is struck down, do you see a need for federal abortion restriction legislation in Congress?","Well, I\u2019d like to associate myself with the remarks of the leader with respect to the leak at the Supreme court. Court is an independent branch of our government and they need to conduct their own independent investigation, get to the bottom of this and hold those responsible accountable. Last week, the president of the United States made a fairly revealing comment when he said that, \u201cChildren are not their parents\u2019 children, when they\u2019re in the classroom.\u201d And it\u2019s revealing in a lot of ways because I think it emphasizes the Democrats view when it comes to kids and the teachers union\u2019s view when it comes to our kids. And I think that was probably put on full display when the administration adopted a rule that requires toddlers to wear mask if they are in a head start facility, even if they are outside on the playground.

BREAK So we\u2019re going to vote today on a congressional review act resolution of disapproval. We disapprove of this rule. Everybody\u2019s going to have an opportunity to go on the record on whether or not toddlers under the age of five, even when they\u2019re outside on the playground, ought to be required to wear mask. And I would point out that even the world health organization has concluded that toddlers shouldn\u2019t have to wear mask. That\u2019s not necessary and that there isn\u2019t a public health or safety benefit associated with that. We think this is a great example of government overreach, of government putting themselves in the role that should be reserved for parents, making decisions that are in the best interest of their children. A vote is going to happen later today and I certainly hope that we not only have every Republican, which I believe we will, but that we\u2019ll have some wise Democrats who want to make sure that our parents are in charge of their children and not the government.","So we\u2019re going to vote today on a congressional review act resolution of disapproval.

Last week, the president of the United States made a fairly revealing comment when he said that, \u201cChildren are not their parents\u2019 children, when they\u2019re in the classroom.\u201d And it\u2019s revealing in a lot of ways because I think it emphasizes the Democrats view when it comes to kids and the teachers union\u2019s view when it comes to our kids. And I think that was probably put on full display when the administration adopted a rule that requires toddlers to wear mask if they are in a head start facility, even if they are outside on the playground.

BREAK So we\u2019re going to vote today on a congressional review act resolution of disapproval. We disapprove of this rule. Everybody\u2019s going to have an opportunity to go on the record on whether or not toddlers under the age of five, even when they\u2019re outside on the playground, ought to be required to wear mask. And I would point out that even the world health organization has concluded that toddlers shouldn\u2019t have to wear mask. That\u2019s not necessary and that there isn\u2019t a public health or safety benefit associated with that. We think this is a great example of government overreach, of government putting themselves in the role that should be reserved for parents, making decisions that are in the best interest of their children. A vote is going to happen later today and I certainly hope that we not only have every Republican, which I believe we will, but that we\u2019ll have some wise Democrats who want to make sure that our parents are in charge of their children and not the government.","So we\u2019re going to vote today on a congressional review act resolution of disapproval.
